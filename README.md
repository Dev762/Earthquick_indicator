# Earthquick_indicator

Reads an Analog accelerometer and communicates the acceleration to the computer, when the value of x,y,z will change then the buzzer will start.
When Earthquick comes then the axis of earth will be change so this project works on this concept and for this purpose we use a accelerometer, which detects the movement in x,y,z axis.
